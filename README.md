## Motivation

- I want to use OBS's Replay Buffer to play only the decisive moments (highlights) of a game match :punch:
- But with just the built-in features, I can only play all recorded or seek manually :cry:
- I want to put pins on the highlights and play back only those parts later :pleading_face:

## How To Use

1. Connect with OBS
1. Start recording replay buffer
1. Press the button at the highlight
1. Stop recording replay buffer
1. Replay only the highlights without editing :sparkles:
